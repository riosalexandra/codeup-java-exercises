public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
//public means the class- we are defining our class
//static is a keyword we'll learn more about later
//void means there is no return type and that it is just going to preform a task
//shortcut for "public static main void" is "psvm"
//system.out line means this is essentially our console.log- it prints out what we see in the console (shortcut for this is 'SOUT')
